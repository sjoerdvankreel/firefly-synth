filter microtuning
DSF falloff to the left
clap polyphonic modulation
full-blown renoise support
fix global unison for mono mode
ditch after-mod, claim micro support ?
show effective modulation in the ui for clap param mod
Feedback FM - but needs per-sample processing, not block
turn on stuff when dragging (e.g. basic sin, dist skew etc)
arpeggiator - hard - but easy -> play multiple octaves on-note. or maybe allow 3/s, 5/s, whatever selection
bugfix: rerender graph on master in param hover?
repaint on waveform change (free running or random-per-voice)
