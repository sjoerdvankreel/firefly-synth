microtuning:
* check up on andreyas comments

autobuilds:
* ask paul
* sign the mac version
* integrate https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/monique-monosynth/blob/main/.github/workflows/build-pr.yml

fix the fake mod params:
* check out this https://steinbergmedia.github.io/vst3_dev_portal/pages/Tutorials/Data+Exchange.html

shortlist:
do fx_test renoise
visual mod demo is borked in new reaper for vst3 only (also on 193)
ditch after-mod, claim micro support ?
do more keyboard tracking just do it -- also trackmode mul/add
do global unison subvoice index as a mod source
turn on stuff when dragging (e.g. basic sin, dist skew etc)
switch juce to direct2d once it gets better (fonts are ugly, checkboxes have severe aliasing) keep taps on https://forum.juce.com/t/how-to-disable-directx-in-juce-8/61822/27
juce::font::getstringwidth is deprecated, but the alternative is slow as molasses, keep taps on https://forum.juce.com/t/juce-8-0-2-glypharrangement-slow-in-debug-builds/63702

wishlist:
should figure out a way to do user supplied formulas?
update the manuals routing overview image with new colors
make a patch cleanup button
update the routing graph for arp
filter micro tuning
DSF falloff to the left
clap polyphonic modulation
full-blown renoise support
fix global unison for mono mode
show effective modulation in the ui for clap param mod
Feedback FM - but needs per-sample processing, not block

wishlist sometime:
midi mpe
cheby shaper
phaser/flanger/chorus
vst3 note expressions
show clap mod indicator
visual routing indicators
automated regression tests
better studiorack integration
do async clear delay lines etc on patch select
glfo + snap + phase > 0.5 not ok
